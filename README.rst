df.to_sql('Salary', sqlite3.Connection('db.sqlite3'), if_exists='append', index=False)
`````

Dynamic table contains all data from db.sqlite3, created with loop:
`````
{% for data in all_salary %}
        <tr>
            <th> {{data.workedyears}} </th>
            <th> {{data.salarybrutto}} </th>
        </tr>
           {% endfor %}
`````
